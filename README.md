# Synthetic Consciousness

Experimental Rust project exploring a conceptual framework for synthetic consciousness
using atomic geometry, attraction, statefulness, and perpetual velocity.

## Disclaimer

This repository is a speculative research and engineering exploration. It does not claim
or guarantee consciousness, sentience, or moral status.

## Vision

Build a Rust-based simulation and agent framework that models:

- Atomic geometry: spatial primitives and topology that influence agent perception.
- Attraction: forces, valence, or potential fields guiding movement and attention.
- Statefulness: persistent internal state, memory, and context.
- Perpetual velocity: continuous dynamical update to avoid static equilibria.

The long-term goal is to study whether such primitives can support emergent behavior that
resembles:

- Meaning-making
- Volitional decision-making ("free will" in a system-design sense)
- Experiencing stimuli
- Disagreement when not convinced by reason or affective signals

## Non-Goals

- Claiming proof of consciousness or sentience
- Replacing ethical or philosophical inquiry with code
- Anthropomorphizing outputs as factual subjective experience

## Conceptual Modules (Planned)

- `geometry`: atomic spatial primitives, topology, and transforms
- `attraction`: fields, forces, valence, and attention potentials
- `state`: memory graphs, context stacks, persistent traits
- `dynamics`: perpetual velocity, integration, and stability
- `agents`: embodied nodes that sense, decide, and act
- `world`: environment, stimuli, and interaction surfaces

## Architecture Sketch

1. World updates produce stimuli from geometry + attraction fields.
2. Agents integrate stimuli with internal state and memory.
3. Decision policies balance reasoned evaluation and affective signals.
4. Actions feed back into world geometry and attraction fields.

## Getting Started (Planned)

- Rust edition: 2021
- Build: `cargo build`
- Run: `cargo run`
- Tests: `cargo test`

## Project Status

Early ideation. Expect rapid changes to model primitives, data structures, and naming.

## Ethics and Safety Notes

- Treat all outputs as artifacts of computation, not proof of inner experience.
- Avoid deploying this system in sensitive or high-stakes domains without review.
- Prefer interpretability and transparency over opaque optimization.

Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue describing the change and the rationale.
